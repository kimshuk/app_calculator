# Calculator

## Version 1
#### Description
Version 1 takes the layout and basic button click functionality built in the 2 previous versions and then ties in the calculation functionality. This version works toward more OOP understandings
by taking the inputs from the calculator and inserting them into objects and then those objects into an array.

## Version 0.5
#### Description
Version 0.5 adds in user functionality without needing to write the underneath logic of a calculator. With the introduction
to the calculator object the user can interact with the object to receive the values after calculation has been completed.

## Version 0.1
#### Description
Version 0.1 is the starting point of the Calculator Project. You must create the base structure and styles, using bootstrap as you deem necessary. For this version we are looking to see that you
understand how to create the basic structure of a web application, style it, and make it reasonably responsive.  No functionality will be encoded with this version.
